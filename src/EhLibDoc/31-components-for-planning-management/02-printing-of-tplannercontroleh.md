# Printing of TPlannerControlEh


The `TPlannerControlEh` components can be printed and previewed before printing.
Use subproperties of `PrintService`  property  to configure and manage printing.
Using of `PrintService` object is very similar to using the same property of `TDBVertGridEh` component. 

See section `Printing of TDBVertGridEh` for details.
