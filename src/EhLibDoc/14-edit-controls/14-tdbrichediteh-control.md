# TDBRichEditEh control


The component is designed for editing multi-line text data with the ability to format (RichText).

The component can operate in Data-aware mode (connected to a DataSet) and not in a simple Data-aware mode.

Properties and methods of the component are similar to those of standard components `TDBRichEdit`.
In addition, the component contains the following additional features:
-	`AlwaysShowBorder`
-	`DynProps`
-	`EditButtons`
-	`EmptyDataInfo`
-	`Flat`
-	`HighlightRequired`
-	`Images`
-	`MRUList`
-	`Tooltips`

When you click on the `Edit` button, the default form opens `DropDown` to edit Rich Text.
