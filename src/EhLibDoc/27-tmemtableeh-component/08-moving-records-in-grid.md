# Moving records in TMemTableEh when dghRecordMoving mode is active


Include `dghRecordMoving` in `OptionsEh` of `DBGridEh` component to allow users moving records inside `TMemTableEh` component.

Besides, when `TreeList` mode is active, `DBGridEh` allows move records inside tree by changing records and level of node. 

To move record at run-time, a user has to press the mouse button above the indicator of record and drag it to required place inside the grid (when multiselect is active user has to select records to move before dragging).
