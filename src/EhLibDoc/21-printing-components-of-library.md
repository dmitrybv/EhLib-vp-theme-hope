# Printing components of Library

EhLib have classes and methods to print and prview next componentns of the Library:
`TDBGridEh`, `TDBVertGridEh`, `TPivotGridEh` and `TPlannerControlEh`.

Due to evolutionary changes in the library there is a different approach to the printing components.
To print TDBGridEh there is a separate component - TPrintDBGridEh. See detail information in the section - [Using TPrintDBGridEh component](10-using-tdbgrideh-component/01-content.md)

 `TDBVertGridEh`, `TPivotGridEh` and `TPlannerControlEh` have a builting property PrintService to configure and manage printing.
