# Definition Rows (Properties Rows, DefaultRowHeight)


Use the `Rows` collection to define the properties of the table rows.

The collection does not require adding strings to define a list of strings. The rows in the collection are created automatically when accessing the items in the collection.

Working with table rows is similar to working with columns.
