# Demo projects


See the full version of the Demo project demonstrating all the features of the `TXlsMemFileEh` class in the folder 
`<EhLib archive>\Demos\XlsFileEh\`

The following features are not supported in the current version of the class:

-	The ability to create files in binary Xls format is not supported.

Limitations:
-	Full-fledged work with the `TXlsMemFileEh` class is possible in `Delphi` version `XE2` and higher or in `Lazarus`. Only in Delphi version XE2 is there a class for generating `Zip` files of version 2, which is used to create `Xslx` files. 

To work with the `TXlsMemFileEh` class in earlier versions of `Delphi`, you must use third-party functions to create `Zip` files. 

For more information about creating Zip files for Delphi versions below XE2, see the files in the `<EhLib Archive>\ZipProviders\ section`.
