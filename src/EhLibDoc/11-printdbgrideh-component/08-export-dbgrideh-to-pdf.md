# Export DBGridEh to PDF


To export `TDBGridEh` to a `Pdf` file, use the `TPrintDBGridEh.PrintToPdfFile` method. The data generation algorithm is similar to the algorithm for printing the `TDBGridEh` component using the `TPrintDBGridEh.Print` method.

The `PrintToPdfFile` method has the following definition:

`procedure TPrintDBGridEh.PrintToPdfFile(AFileName: String);`

In the `AFileName` parameter, you must pass the full path and name of the pdf file to be generated.
