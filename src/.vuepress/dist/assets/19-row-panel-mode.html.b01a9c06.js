Set <code>RowPanel.Active</code> to <code>True</code> value to activate this mode. At design-time you can place cell, vertical and horizontal size. At run-time the possibility to change position of cell depends on the presence <code>dghColumnMove</code> value in <code>OptionsEh</code> property.

By analogy when user changes cell height, grid changes height of cells in left or right part of grid if low borders march. Press and hold <code>Shift</code> key to change the size of only single cell.</p><p>To change cell height of cell you need to move mouse cursor to the low border of the title cell.
