<p>TDBGridEh allows showing special sortmarking bitmaps (small triangles) in the right part of title cell. In order to automatically mark the title by sortmarking bitmaps you have to add dghAutoSortMarking to OptionsEh property. Add dghMultiSortMarking to OptionsEh in order to allow sortmarking in several columns simultaneously. Set Column.Title.TitleButton to true value for titles which will have possibility to change sortmarkers at run time. Or you can set ColumnDefValues.Title.TitleButton to allow setting sortmarking for all columns where Column.Title.TitleButton is not changed. At runtime, clicking on title will change sortmarking. Holding Ctrl key allows to mark several columns simultaneously. After user changes sormarking grid will call OnSortMarkingChanged event or will pass action to special object, if it is registered. Special object will use Grid.SortLocal property to determine how to sort data: locally or on the server. If you write OnSortMarkingChanged, you can use TDBGrid.SortMarkedColumns property to access the sortmarked columns and TColumnEh.Title.SortMarker property to get state of the sortmarker.</p>
